# Capstone-Project-by-KPMG-Sales-Forecast-Analysis
In this project, I've analyzed and forecasted sales of pesticides for a domestic pesticide manufacturing company (ABC Manufacturing) and analyzed variables that impact the sales of the product. This will enable the pesticide company to manage the production to meet growth/slowdown in sales as per the sales forecast.
Chemical control of pests is a common practice in agriculture. There are more than a thousand pesticides of both chemical and biological nature, used around the world to minimize crop losses. Agriculture in developing countries suffers most because of high incidence of various pests. Although chemical pesticides are well known for their effectiveness, their impact on soil and environment, and presence of residue in food products are a matter of concern. Other issues relate to structure of pesticide industry and the regulations for registration and quality assessment.
While there are numerous factors affecting sale trends of pesticide, including and not limited to, socio-political factors such as changes in regulation, population growth, rising incomes of population, weather condition, etc.; you will be specifically analyzing the impact of rainfall on the Pesticide consumption trend.
I've also used the rainfall data & Agricutural GDP to check their impact on sales of pesticides.
Objective:
Conduct state wise trend analysis of the given sales
To identify other reasons if they are influencing Pesticide sales
To provide state wise forecast of Pesticide sales for ABC Manufacturing
